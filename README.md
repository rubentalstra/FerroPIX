A Master Patient Index for the openEHR platform, in pure Rust: who the patient is.

Every organisation issues its own identifiers for the same person, and records move. FerroPIX holds the cross-reference between those identifiers and the location of each record, and answers the question every other component starts with: who is this patient, and where is their record. It exposes that over the IHE profiles integrators already expect, PIX and PDQ, in their FHIR forms PIXm and PDQm, and it keeps identifying data outside the clinical record, which is where the openEHR Platform Service Model puts the EHR Index.

FerroPIX is one of the [FerroHEALTH](https://ferrohealth.eu/) family. The family
page shows where it sits among the eight and what calls what, and this
repository is where the design and the build happen; the tracker is the
record of both. Its site will be <https://ferropix.eu/>.
